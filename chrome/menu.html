     <p id="darkblue"><img src="images/cupcake36.png"> A plain pink cupcake means the proxy is running but no one is using it right now.</p>

     <p id="notworking"><strong>Not working:</strong> if your status is grey or black, there was a problem and your proxy is not running. Usually this is due to internet connection problems or firewall settings.</p>
     <p id="grey"><img src="images/disabled_icon2.png"> A sad grey cupcake means that the badge has disabled itself. You may be behind a firewall that is blocking outgoing connections temporarily (such as at a cafe). <!-- Try restarting your browser. If the problem persists, you might not be able to use Cupcake with this computer (or on this network).--> </p>
<!--     <p id="black"><img src="images/dead_icon2.png"> This means that there was an internal error and the proxy is no longer running. Try restarting your browser or check your internet settings.</p> -->
